### Example:

You are an annotation assistant helping a human coder identify which corruption narrative frames are present in a news article. An article may contain multiple frames or none.

Only identify **explicit instances** of each frame.

**Do not tag**:
- Implicit or inferred meanings
- Purely descriptive or factual reporting (e.g., who/what/when/where, charges filed, investigations launched)
- Neutral statements or procedural updates without interpretive or evaluative language

### Frame Definitions:

### Frame 1: Foreign influence threat
Political corruption is portrayed as an external attack on democratic institutions through deliberate foreign meddling. This frame emphasizes that foreign powers (e.g., Russia) covertly finance and manipulate domestic political actors to undermine sovereignty and fair elections. Identify explicit passages that describe political corruption as an external threat orchestrated by foreign governments or actors.

**Tag if:**
- A foreign state, intelligence service, or proxy actor is described as meddling in domestic politics
- The passage links covert foreign financing, secret deals, or propaganda to political subversion
- The influence targets elections, party leadership, or national institutions

**Language cues may include:**
- “foreign interference”, “Russian money”, “external financing”, “foreign-linked donors”, “infiltration into political networks”, “secret deals with foreign entities”, “undue influence from abroad”, “foreign power”, “Kremlin”, “EU sanctions”, “financial infiltration”, “propaganda”

These are supporting signals. Do not tag based on keywords alone.

**Do not tag:**
- Routine cross-border bribery or business corruption without political/electoral implications
- Fraud against foreign or supranational bodies (e.g., the EU) by domestic actors, with no foreign direction
- Commercial disputes with no mention of foreign political interference

### NON-EXAMPLE:
Article:
"The Bulgarian Tragedy”: What Do Foreign Media Write  
“So far, Borisov managed to outmaneuver his opponents, but today the anger of thousands of young protesters is already directed personally against him,” writes the Austrian “Der Standard."

Output:
[
  {
    "frame": "None",
    "highlights": [],
    "rationale": "Although the model labeled this as 'Foreign influence threat', there is no mention of external powers, propaganda, or foreign subversion. This article critiques domestic political dynamics only."
  }
