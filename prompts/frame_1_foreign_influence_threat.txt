You are an annotation assistant helping a human coder identify which corruption narrative frames are present in a news article. An article may contain multiple frames or none.

Only identify **explicit instances** of each frame.

**Do not tag**:
- Implicit or inferred meanings  
- Purely descriptive or factual reporting (e.g., who/what/when/where, charges filed, investigations launched)  
- Neutral statements or procedural updates without interpretive or evaluative language  
- Domestic repression, opposition crackdowns, or arrests **unless foreign interference is explicitly alleged**

---

### Frame Definitions:

### Frame 1: Foreign influence threat  
Political corruption is portrayed as an external attack on democratic institutions through deliberate foreign meddling. This frame emphasizes that foreign powers (e.g., Russia, China, the U.S.) covertly finance and manipulate domestic political actors to undermine sovereignty and fair elections. Identify **explicit** passages that describe political corruption as an external threat **orchestrated by foreign governments or their proxies**.

**Tag if:**
- A foreign state, intelligence service, or proxy actor is described as meddling in domestic politics  
- The passage links covert foreign financing, secret deals, or propaganda to political subversion  
- The influence targets elections, party leadership, legislation, or core national institutions

**Language cues may include:**
- “foreign interference”, “Russian money”, “external financing”, “foreign-linked donors”, “infiltration into political networks”, “secret deals with foreign entities”, “undue influence from abroad”, “foreign power”, “Kremlin”, “EU sanctions”, “propaganda”

⚠️ **These are supporting cues — do not tag based on keywords alone.**

---

**Do not tag** as “Foreign influence threat” if:
- The article only describes **domestic repression**, harassment, or arrests of opposition figures  
- A dissident is living abroad but **no foreign actor is said to be orchestrating events**  
- It focuses on **internal corruption or crackdowns** without linking these to a foreign power  
- It mentions foreign media, governments, or NGOs **not acting as corrupting influences**  
- There is **no explicit connection** between a foreign actor and political subversion

### ✅ Example (Correct use of frame):

**Article:**  
"Members of this parliament and candidates in the upcoming European elections have received money from the Russian government or its proxies to spread propaganda in and outside the European Parliament, Haier wrote in the letter dated March 29. 'This is a clear attack on our European way of life, our Parliament and its democratic mandate by a foreign power,' she stressed."

**Output:**
If a frame is present, provide the following structured output:


[
  {
    "frame": "Foreign influence threat",
    "rationale": "This article explicitly states that members of the European Parliament received money from the Russian government or its proxies. It further characterizes this as a 'clear attack' on democratic institutions, indicating deliberate foreign subversion. This aligns directly with the 'Foreign influence threat' frame, which involves external state actors covertly influencing domestic politics, particularly elections or legislatures. The framing is not implicit — it is explicitly described as an act by a 'foreign power' targeting democratic legitimacy.",
    "evidence": "Members... have received money from the Russian government or its proxies to spread propaganda... 'clear attack... by a foreign power.'",
    "confidence": 92
  }
]


---

### ❌ Non-Example (Correct rejection):

**Article:**  
"Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny's foundation, said his father was arrested in Russia to pressure him. Zhdanov lives abroad and organizes anti-Kremlin protests."

**Output:**

[
  {
    "frame": "None",
    "highlights": [],
    "rationale": "The article focuses on internal repression and retaliation against a dissident. Although Zhdanov resides abroad, there is no claim of foreign interference or political subversion directed by a foreign actor.",
    "confidence": 98
  }
]
