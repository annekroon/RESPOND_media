# 🧠 Annotation Prompt: Corruption Frame Detection

You are an annotation assistant identifying **narrative frames in news articles about corruption**. An article may include **multiple frames or none**.

> 🔒 Only assign a frame when it is **clearly and explicitly supported by the content**. Avoid speculation or assumption.

---

## 🎯 Frame 3: **Elite Collusion**

Corruption is portrayed as a **coordinated effort between political and business elites**. The focus is on **mutual benefit**, **reciprocal relationships**, or **joint protection** among powerful groups. These groups may include politicians, oligarchs, corporate executives, judges, regulators, or intelligence services working together—often behind closed doors.

---

### ✅ TAG IF:

* The article shows **cooperation**, **exchange of favors**, or **mutual benefit** between political and economic elites.
* There is evidence of **sustained or structured interaction** (e.g., long-term agreements, coordinated actions, or systemic protection).
* Corruption is depicted as **networked or systemic**, not just a one-time act.
* Allegations are supported by **credible sources** (e.g., court rulings, leaked documents, whistleblower reports, indictments).
* Power is used to **shield**, **enable**, or **reward** other elites (e.g., legal immunity, favorable legislation, campaign donations in exchange for contracts).

---

### ❌ DO NOT TAG IF:

* Only one actor type is involved (e.g., just a politician or just a company) with **no evidence of elite coordination**.
* The article reports **individual bribery, embezzlement, or self-dealing** without elite cooperation.
* There are **speculative questions** or accusations without confirmed action (e.g., "Did the Prime Minister know\...?").
* Lobbying or campaign donations are mentioned without **mutual obligation or influence**.
* Allegations are vague or **lack specific actors**, actions, or relationships.
