# üß† Annotation Prompt: Corruption Frame Detection

You are an annotation assistant identifying **narrative frames in news articles about corruption**. An article may include **multiple frames or none**.

> üîí Only assign a frame when it is **clearly and explicitly supported by the content**. Avoid speculation or assumption.

---

## üéØ Frame 3: **Elite Collusion**

Corruption is portrayed as a **coordinated effort between political and business elites**. The focus is on **mutual benefit**, **reciprocal relationships**, or **joint protection** among powerful groups. These groups may include politicians, oligarchs, corporate executives, judges, regulators, or intelligence services working together ‚Äî often behind closed doors.

---

### ‚úÖ TAG IF:

- The article shows **cooperation**, **exchange of favors**, or **mutual benefit** between political and economic elites.
- There is evidence of **sustained or structured interaction** (e.g., long-term agreements, coordinated actions, or systemic protection).
- Corruption is depicted as **networked or systemic**, not just a one-time act.
- Allegations are supported by **credible sources** (e.g., court rulings, leaked documents, whistleblower reports, indictments).
- Power is used to **shield**, **enable**, or **reward** other elites (e.g., legal immunity, favorable legislation, campaign donations in exchange for contracts).

---

### ‚ùå DO NOT TAG IF:

- Only one actor type is involved (e.g., just a politician or just a company), with **no evidence of elite coordination**.
- The article reports **individual bribery, embezzlement, or self-dealing** without elite cooperation.
- There are **speculative questions** or accusations without confirmed action (e.g., `"Did the Prime Minister know?"`).
- Lobbying or campaign donations are mentioned **without mutual obligation or influence**.
- Allegations are vague or **lack specific actors**, actions, or relationships.

## ‚úÖ Positive Examples

### üìú Article

> ‚ÄúAn Italian court found that top officials from the transport ministry colluded with construction firms to overbill a public highway project. In exchange, the firms donated to party campaigns and employed relatives of senior officials.‚Äù

```json
[
  {
    "frame": "Elite Collusion",
    "rationale": "This article fits the 'Elite Collusion' frame because it explicitly documents coordinated corruption between political elites (transport ministry officials) and economic elites (construction firms). The arrangement included mutual benefits ‚Äî campaign donations and nepotistic hiring ‚Äî in return for public overbilling. The description aligns directly with the frame‚Äôs definition of reciprocal relationships among powerful groups working behind closed doors for mutual gain.",
    "evidence": "Top officials from the transport ministry colluded with construction firms... firms donated to party campaigns and employed relatives of senior officials.",
    "confidence": 92
  }

### üìú Article

```json
[
  {
    "frame": "Elite Collusion",
    "rationale": "The article matches the 'Elite Collusion' frame because it details long-term cooperation between political and corporate elites. Energy companies provided campaign funding, while senators returned the favor with legislation that protected corporate monopolies. The mention of behind-closed-door meetings among lobbyists and regulators highlights systemic coordination and mutual protection ‚Äî core traits of elite collusion.",

```json
[
  {
    "frame": "Elite Collusion",
    "rationale": "This case clearly reflects the 'Elite Collusion' frame. The prolonged solicitation of bribes by two senior officials from Chad in exchange for access to national oil rights demonstrates a coordinated, mutually beneficial relationship between political elites and foreign corporate interests. The involvement of high-ranking diplomats and the structured nature of the exchange point to elite-level cooperation as defined by the frame.",
    "evidence": "Chad‚Äôs former ambassador and deputy were indicted for soliciting a $2 million bribe over several years from a Canadian energy company to secure oil rights.",
    "confidence": 90
  }
