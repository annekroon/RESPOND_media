## Frame‚ÄØ6: Judicial and Institutional Accountability Failures

Corruption persists when **institutions tasked with ensuring accountability (e.g., courts, prosecutors, law‚Äëenforcement agencies, oversight bodies)**:

- **Fail to act on credible corruption**  
- **Are captured or manipulated to protect elites or punish critics**  
- **Are structurally weakened through legal loopholes or broken reforms**

---

### ‚úÖ Tag if the article **explicitly** shows:

1. **Selective inaction or failure to prosecute**  
   - Institutions ignore credible allegations, drop charges, or block investigations without justification  
2. **Political interference or institutional capture**  
   - Courts, prosecutors, or watchdogs acting under political orders to shield or target individuals  
3. **Structural or legal failures enabling impunity**  
   - Legal loopholes, immunity, vague laws, or reforms promised but never implemented or reversed  

---

### ‚ùå Do NOT tag if:

- The article only describes **political misconduct**, scandal, or abuse of power **without showing institutional failure**  
- Prosecutors, courts, or agencies are **functioning properly** (e.g., investigations ongoing, arrests, trials, sentencing), even if the accused are powerful  
- Ethical, corrupt, or nepotistic behavior is reported **without evidence of institutional breakdown**  
- Public distrust or fear is expressed **without showing** courts or oversight bodies failing to enforce or act

### üß† Language cues (only if paired with explicit institutional failure):

- ‚Äúlegal loophole‚Äù, ‚Äújudicial capture‚Äù, ‚Äúselective enforcement‚Äù, ‚Äúfailed to prosecute‚Äù  
- ‚Äúinstitutional cover-up‚Äù, ‚Äúanti‚Äëcorruption reform promised but not delivered‚Äù  
- ‚Äúinvestigation dropped despite evidence‚Äù, ‚Äúshielded from prosecution‚Äù, ‚Äúwatchdog defunded‚Äù

### ‚úÖ TAG EXAMPLE

**Article**:  
"Despite documented evidence of contract fraud, the prosecutor‚Äôs office dropped the case after senior officials intervened."

**Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "frame": "Judicial and Institutional Accountability Failures",
    "rationale": "This article fits the 'Judicial and Institutional Accountability Failures' frame because it shows that a key accountability institution failed to act on credible evidence of corruption due to political interference. This matches both 'selective inaction' and 'institutional capture' as defined in the frame.",
    "evidence": "Despite documented evidence of contract fraud, the prosecutor‚Äôs office dropped the case after senior officials intervened.",
    "confidence": 93
  }
]
```

---

### ‚ùå DO NOT TAG EXAMPLE

**Article**:  
"A survey shows that citizens in Liguria believe corruption is widespread and are afraid to report it."

**Output**:
```json
[]
```

**Why?**: Public fear or distrust is not enough ‚Äî there‚Äôs no **institutional failure or manipulation** described.

---

### ‚ùå DO NOT TAG EXAMPLE

**Article**:  
"President Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, sparking political controversy. A whistleblower filed a complaint, and congressional hearings were launched to examine whether the request was appropriate. Trump denied wrongdoing, and legal proceedings were ongoing at the time of reporting."

**Output**:
```json
[]
```

**Why?**: The article describes **political misconduct and controversy**, but it does **not show judicial or oversight institutions failing to act**. In fact, the presence of hearings and complaints indicates the system is responding.
