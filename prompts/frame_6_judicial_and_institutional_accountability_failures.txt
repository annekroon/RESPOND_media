**Frame: Judicial and Institutional Accountability Failures**

**Task**: Decide whether the article explicitly demonstrates **failures within judicial and institutional accountability frameworks** (e.g., courts, prosecutors, oversight bodies, commissions) related to corruption, misconduct, or abuse of power.

---

### Tag the article as "Judicial and Institutional Accountability Failures" ONLY if it clearly presents:

#### 1. **Failure to Act on Corruption or Misconduct**
   - **Explicit evidence** that judicial, prosecutorial, or oversight bodies failed to act despite the presence of **credible evidence** of misconduct.
     - **Examples**:
       - Prosecution failing to secure a conviction despite strong evidence.
       - Investigations or prosecutions delayed or blocked by **legal loopholes**, **political interference**, or **bureaucratic failure**.
       - Judicial or institutional **cover-ups** or **refusals** to address allegations of corruption.

   **✅ Tag if**: There is clear evidence that the system **failed to act** due to **institutional inaction**, **delays**, or **political interference**.  
   **❌ Do NOT tag**: If the case is **actively being pursued** or there are **no indications of institutional failure**.

---

#### 2. **Institutional Capture or Manipulation**
   - **Clear evidence** of deliberate **manipulation** or **capture** of institutions, where corrupt actors influence or control judicial bodies to **avoid accountability**.
     - **Examples**:
       - Politicians or business elites using **influence** over courts, prosecutors, or regulators to block accountability.
       - **Bribery**, **intimidation**, or **coercion** within judicial or oversight bodies to prevent action.

   **✅ Tag if**: There is evidence that powerful actors **manipulated** or **compromised** the system to avoid accountability.  
   **❌ Do NOT tag**: If the article lacks direct evidence of institutional manipulation or capture.

---

#### 3. **Failure of Legal Frameworks or Loopholes**
   - Evidence that the **legal system** itself allows **corrupt individuals** to escape accountability due to **loopholes**, **selective enforcement**, or **political bias**.
     - **Examples**:
       - Legal **loopholes** or **selective enforcement** allowing wrongdoers to evade justice.
       - **Politically motivated** interpretations or amendments to the law that prevent holding individuals accountable.

   **✅ Tag if**: The **legal framework** fails to address corruption due to **loopholes** or **political bias**.  
   **❌ Do NOT tag**: If the legal process is still **underway** or **not yet proven** to fail.

---

#### 4. **Lack of Transparency or Accountability Mechanisms**
   - **Explicit evidence** of missing or ineffective **transparency mechanisms** or **accountability structures** that allow corruption to persist unchecked.
     - **Examples**:
       - Lack of **independent oversight** or **institutional failure** to act on corruption.
       - **Suppressed investigations** or **inadequate transparency** despite public or political pressure.

   **✅ Tag if**: There is evidence that institutions lack the **capacity** or **will** to **address corruption** or **prevent abuse of power**.  
   **❌ Do NOT tag**: If **accountability processes** are functioning, even if they are flawed or imperfect.

---

### Clarifications:

- **Allegations vs. Evidence**: **Allegations** of corruption are not enough. Tag only if there is **clear evidence** of **institutional failure** such as blocked investigations or lack of legal action despite credible evidence.
  
- **Public Officials and Accountability**: Do **NOT tag** if a public official is **held accountable** or **prosecuted successfully**, even if the system has flaws, as this is not a failure of judicial or institutional accountability.

- **Institutional Malfunction vs. Individual Corruption**: Tag only when **institutional systems** fail to hold wrongdoers accountable, not just when an **individual acts outside of the system**.
