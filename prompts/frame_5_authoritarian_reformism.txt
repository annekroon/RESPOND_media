### Frame: Authoritarian Reformism


This frame applies when **leaders or regimes justify** **concentrating power** in the hands of the executive or suspending democratic institutions to fight corruption — even at the expense of democratic norms, checks, and balances.

#### Assign this frame when:
- **Leaders** justify **centralization of power** or **suspension of democratic processes** (e.g., courts, legislature, oversight bodies) as necessary to fight corruption.
- **Executive power** is framed as **essential to stop corruption**, even if it involves **bypassing judicial, legislative, or oversight bodies**.
- Reform is framed as a **top-down, order-restoring mission** — often with the **justification of an emergency** or **crisis**.
- The article includes **proposals to bypass democratic institutions** or **centralize executive power** as a necessary response to corruption.

#### Do NOT tag if:
- The article discusses **corruption** or **lack of transparency** without justifying **strong, centralized power** as a solution.
- The article includes **criticism of authoritarian actions** but does **not justify** the centralization of power to solve corruption.
- **Accountability** and **transparency** are called for **through existing democratic institutions** without a call for **emergency powers** or **centralization**.

#### Example Triggers:
- **Justification of executive control** over **judicial independence** to fight corruption.
- **Emergency powers** invoked to suspend **parliamentary oversight** for corruption investigations.
- **Calls for centralized control** framed as necessary to address systemic corruption.

#### Non-examples:
- **Criticism** of political figures for corruption without justifying authoritarian responses.
- **Proposals for procedural reforms** that do not centralize power.
