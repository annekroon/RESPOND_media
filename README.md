# Task 8.1 – Investigating Corruption and Anti-Corruption Discourse

**Lead institution**: University of Amsterdam (UvA)  
**Collaborating partners**: ACREC, Sciences Po, UGOT, Unibo, KCL, IGA, GTI  
**Project timeline**: Months 3–18

## Overview

Task 8.1 investigates the social construction of corruption and anti-corruption in legacy and social media. We apply advanced computational methods combined with manual annotation to analyze large-scale textual data from news and Meta social media platforms.

## Objectives

This task seeks to:

- Examine public discourse on political corruption.  
- Collect media content from diverse sources, including news APIs and Meta’s public content library.  
- Investigate corruption coverage across nine countries for the period 2018–2024.

## Methodology

Data collection and analysis follow a two-step approach:

1. **Inductive Exploration** – Discover latent topics, frames, and actor networks.  
2. **Deductive Evaluation** – Analyze specific frames and actors about political corruption and actor roles.
